                    <h1>Hello!</h1>
                    <p>Currently, I’m doing my Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering also working as a freelance WordPress Designer and Developer from last 1 years. I know it was a very early age to start and being a professional but because of my passion about tech, design, and the role they play in our everyday lives it was much more enjoyable rather than extra pressure for me.</p>
